          During Songkran, bring only the necessities, such as your phone, wallet and camera. In order to keep your items dry and secure, the use of a watertight capsule, such as a small pouch or a ziploc bag, is crucial. Ziploc bags can be purchased at almost all shopping centres and convenience stores. Additionally, phone pouches which are incredibly popular at this time can be purchased from markets and most streets during Songkran for an approximate cost of à¸¿50. If you plan on bringing more than just a phone and wallet, a waterproof bag may be necessary to carry excess goods.

          Although these methods will almost always keep your items secure, there is still the possibility of water damage. In the case of an electronic device being splashed with water, switch off the device immediately and remove the battery, sim card, and any other damageable items in a dry place. Attempt to dry these items as quickly as possible using either a towel or paper towel, which can be purchased at a convenience store.
        </p>

          The other danger to your items during Songkran is the possibility of pickpocketing. Ensure you keep your personal belongings securely in your front pockets, around your neck in a phone pouch, or in a visible bag. Keeping your items in your front pockets rather than the back is a safer option as they are always visible. Keeping them in a pouch around your neck is the most popular and convenient option, as this too is almost always visible in the case that someone attempts to steal your belongings . If taking a bag, make sure you can see it at all times and ensure that it is waterproof. Lastly, wearing your backpack at the front of your body is also an option in the case that you have larger or heavier items you require during the festival.
