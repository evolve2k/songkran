        <p>
          During Songkran, bring only the necessities, such as your phone, wallet and camera. In order to keep your items dry and secure, the use of a watertight capsule, such as a small pouch or a ziploc bag, is crucial. Ziploc bags can be purchased at almost all shopping centres and convenience stores. Additionally, phone pouches which are incredibly popular at this time can be purchased from markets and most streets during Songkran for an approximate cost of ฿50. If you plan on bringing more than just a phone and wallet, a waterproof bag may be necessary to carry excess goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although these methods will almost always keep your items secure, there is still the possibility of water damage. In the case of an electronic device being splashed with water, switch off the device immediately and remove the battery, sim card, and any other damageable items in a dry place. Attempt to dry these items as quickly as possible using either a towel or paper towel, which can be purchased at a convenience store.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other danger to your items during Songkran is the possibility of pickpocketing. Ensure you keep your personal belongings securely in your front pockets, around your neck in a phone pouch, or in a visible bag. Keeping your items in your front pockets rather than the back is a safer option as they are always visible. Keeping them in a pouch around your neck is the most popular and convenient option, as this too is almost always visible in the case that someone attempts to steal your belongings . If taking a bag, make sure you can see it at all times and ensure that it is waterproof. Lastly, wearing your backpack at the front of your body is also an option in the case that you have larger or heavier items you require during the festival.

          Songkran is the annual celebration of Thailand signalling the start of Thai New Year which takes place in mid April. The word Songkran means change or movement, and refers to the changing of seasons, the movement of the position of the sun in the sky and the vernal equinox. Songkran is influenced, both in customs and its celebration of season, by Indian and Chinese cultures, as well as Buddhist traditions. It is thought to have been celebrated in Thailand since at least the 13th Century.

        </p>
        <p>
          Marking the beginning of the traditional Thai calendar, it is historically celebrated by the cleaning of the house and home to remove any negative influences from the previous year and to ensure good luck for the year to come. Respect and homage is also paid to ancestors and elders of the family and community. This is represented through water blessings, where water is poured over the image of Buddha and onto the hands of elders. This tradition of using water to pay respect has evolved over time to celebratory water fights all over Thailand.

          <h2>What To Wear</h2>
          <div class="header-video">

          </div>

         Despite the weather being approximately 40 degrees (Celsius) in Thailand at this time, it is important to be respectful of the more conservative culture and the holiday.
        </p>
        <h3>T-shirt and Shorts</h3>
        <p>
          A good colourful t-shirt and some shorts will be perfect! Cover your shoulders to be respectful of the modest culture and to protect them from the sun. Board shorts are ideal as they will dry very quickly, but make sure they are not too short. Most Thai people do not mind the different clothing standards for tourists. However, be wary as some people have been fined for wearing items too revealing.
        </p>
        <h3>Swim Suit</h3>
        <p>
       Wear a swimsuit or bikini under your clothes, it will dry fast and hold its shape better than some undergarments.
        </p>
        <h3>Thongs/Flip Flops</h3>
        <p>
          Wear some plain, cheap thongs/flip flops as these shoes have to survive getting wet all day. Additionally, they are quick drying and easy to clean. Keep in mind that the shoes you wear are likely to be destroyed or go missing throughout the day.
        </p>
        <h3>Goggles</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes the water is not clean and can lead to eye irritation and infections, so goggles can be used to prevent this. We recommend swimming goggles, but you can also purchase goggles or glasses at the water playing areas.
        </p>
        <h3>Avoid</h3>
        <p>
          Avoid wearing white fabrics, as they will most likely become see-through during the water fight. Also avoid thick garments, such as jeans, as these will become heavy and uncomfortable.
        </p>

          <h2>What To Buy</h2>
          <div class="header-video">

         As the Songkran festival is known for water fights, being prepared and knowing what to buy will contribute to a successful and fun week. Here is a list of purchases to be made before Songkran begins:
        </p>
        <h3>Waterproof Pouch</h3>
        <p>
          Waterproof pouches are essential for storing your phone, money and other small personal belongings. These pouches are inexpensive and are available in clear, giving you the ability to use your phone and take photos if desired. These can be purchased prior at shopping centres, convenience stores and markets, or at water gun stands during the festival.
        </p>
        <h3>Water Gun</h3>
        <p>
          Another necessity is a water gun. During Songkran you can find water guns almost anywhere which will cost approximately ฿150, depending on the size. The bigger the gun the better, as this ensures you will save money throughout the week with fewer refills required.
        </p>
        <h3>Waterproof Camera</h3>
        <p>
          An option for better quality photos, is to invest in a waterproof camera. If you do not want to spend money, just know that taking photos with your phone in your waterproof pouch can result in the image having water smudges.
        </p>
        <h3>Thongs/Flip Flops</h3>
        <p>
          If you do not have any, purchase some inexpensive flip flops to be worn for the duration of the festival. Avoid impracticable footwear made from materials such as fabric and leather. In the situation that your thongs/flip flops break or are lost, a replacement pair can be purchased from stands or convenience stores.
        </p>
