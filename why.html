          Songkran is the annual celebration of Thailand signalling the start of Thai New Year which takes place in mid April. The word Songkran means change or movement, and refers to the changing of seasons, the movement of the position of the sun in the sky and the vernal equinox. Songkran is influenced, both in customs and its celebration of season, by Indian and Chinese cultures, as well as Buddhist traditions. It is thought to have been celebrated in Thailand since at least the 13th Century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marking the beginning of the traditional Thai calendar, it is historically celebrated by the cleaning of the house and home to remove any negative influences from the previous year and to ensure good luck for the year to come. Respect and homage is also paid to ancestors and elders of the family and community. This is represented through water blessings, where water is poured over the image of Buddha and onto the hands of elders. This tradition of using water to pay respect has evolved over time to celebratory water fights all over Thailand.

          Songkran is an annual celebration that stretches over a 3 day period, officially starting on April 13. The term Songkran refers to moving or changing, and more specifically, relating to the sun changing to a new zodiac, or new year. Despite the festival having a strong focus on water fights, there are also traditional aspects of the festival which include water ceremonies and using chalk to mark blessings.

        </p>
        <p>
          In modern society the spiritual and religious aspects of Songkran are taken more seriously by traditionalists, or elders of the community. As one of the main aspects of this festival includes throwing water on others, a more traditional way to be involved is through the Rod Nam Dam Hua ceremony. This ceremony enables you to be blessed by the elders, by sprinkling a small amount of water over their hands. The concept of throwing water in this festival originated from pouring perfumed water over Buddha images in prosper to receive good fortune in the new year. Additionally, chalk is also used during Songkran to mark blessings in order to bring protection and good luck. This ritual was originally performed by monks. The chalk is available to be purchased during the festival and when mixed with water is used to give blessing by marking the faces of others.

          Cleaning for the new year, preparing food and offering the food and new robes to monks are also rituals performed during Songkran, where each activity is completed on a different day over the duration of the festival. Typically the first day of the new year is when the prepared food and robes are offered to monks. This day is referred to as Wan Payawan, which was traditionally the first day to toss water.

         The word Songkran translates to ‘move into’. It embodies the Thai concept of Sanook or ‘fun’. There are also deeper traditional celebrations and rituals. Water plays a central role in the rituals as it represents cleansing and purification and is a symbol of renewal. A spring clean of home and temples is completed before the beginning of the festival.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wan Payawan is one of the main rituals of the festival, which involves sprinkling lustral water over Buddha statues and images. This custom is a part of the cleaning aspect of Songkran, and occurs on the third day, but can also be seen in the lead up to the festival.The 'blessed' water used to clean the Buddha images is then used to bless other people and bring good fortune.
        </p>
        <p>
          Family also plays an important part of Songkran. It is a time where family members come together to show appreciation, love and respect to each other as well as making merit and paying homage to their ancestors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having chalk placed on your face is a custom originating from the chalk used by monks to mark blessings. This combination of water and powder is almost identical to the celebrations of Holi. It is thought that the customs originated in India, as Songkran is celebrated more widely and longer in the Northern Thailand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tradition of honouring the elders is implemented by younger members of society to older members. Traditionally, this involves gently pouring scented water over the shoulders and down the back of the elders. This has been simplified to sprinkling water over their hands in order to exchange a blessing to the younger.
